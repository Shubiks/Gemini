Always check the local regulations and follow the instructions on the parking ticket carefully."

The StVO is a federal law, meaning it applies to the entire country. It was first enacted in 1934 and has been amended several times since then.\n\nThe StVO is overseen by the Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur (BMVI), which is the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. The BMVI is responsible for developing and updating the regulations, as well as ensuring their enforcement.\n\nLocal authorities, such as the Ordnungsamt (municipal public order office) and the police, are responsible for enforcing the parking regulations in their respective jurisdictions. They are authorized to issue parking tickets and take further legal action against offenders.\n\nThe specific fines and penalties for parking in no-parking areas are determined by the individual states (Bundesländer) in Germany. Each state has its own set of regulations and fee schedules for parking offenses.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to pinpoint a single individual or entity that \"framed\" the law against parking in no-parking areas in Germany. It is a collective effort involving the federal government, state governments, and local authorities, all working together to ensure safe and orderly traffic flow on German roads."

The StVO is a federal law, meaning it applies to the entire country. It was first enacted in 1934 and has been amended several times since then.\\n\\nThe StVO is overseen by the Bundesministerium f\\303\\274r Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur (BMVI), which is the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. The BMVI is responsible for developing and updating the regulations, as well as ensuring their enforcement.\\n\\nLocal authorities, such as the Ordnungsamt (municipal public order office) and the police, are responsible for enforcing the parking regulations in their respective jurisdictions. They are authorized to issue parking tickets and take further legal action against offenders.\\n\\nThe specific fines and penalties for parking in no-parking areas are determined by the individual states (Bundesl\\303\\244nder) in Germany. Each state has its own set of regulations and fee schedules for parking offenses.\\n\\nTherefore, it is not possible to pinpoint a single individual or entity that \\\"framed\\\" the law against parking in no-parking areas in Germany. It is a collective effort involving the federal government, state governments, and local authorities, all working together to ensure safe and orderly traffic flow on German roads.\"\n",
