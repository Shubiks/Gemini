# Gemini Features

## Introduction

**Gemini** is the latest breakthrough in the AI world, renowned for its exceptional capabilities in generating content and understanding images and videos. It sets a new benchmark in AI technology, promising to evolve and outperform itself with each subsequent version.

## Video Capability Feature

### Steps to Use

1. **Create `capture.py` and `video.py` files**:
   - These scripts will capture frames from a video and process them using Gemini's vision model.

2. **Create a Folder**:
   - Create a folder named `frames` where `frame.png` will be saved.

3. **Set Up Video Path and Google API Key**:
   - Provide the video file path and your Google API key in the scripts.

4. **Run the Scripts**:
   - First, run `capture.py` to capture frames from the video.
   - Then, run `video.py` to analyze the frames using Gemini.

### Example

Here's an example of how to set up and run the scripts:

# Step 1: Run capture.py
python capture.py

# Step 2: Run video.py
python video.py
